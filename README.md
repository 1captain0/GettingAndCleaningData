Submission by : Kevin Benny(kevinbenny@karunya.edu.in)
It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

**Dataset used in the project**
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

**Files**
*CodeBook.md* a code book that describes all the variables , data and transformations perfored with the dataset

*'run_analysis.R'* performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one dataset.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
4.Giving labels to the dataset with descriptive variable names.
5.From the dataset in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6.IndependentData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
